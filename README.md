## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Positioning of background images. The card component does'nt shift with the width it stays constant in all the widths need to be carefull handling this in responsiveness. This project is a nice application of flexbox.
